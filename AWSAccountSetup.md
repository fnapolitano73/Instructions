# The AWS Environment Setup Guide

Welcome to the OGP Summit Hackathon!

This guide will show you how to get your team access to your AWS credits for
the hackathon

-   Each team receives \$140 in AWS credits ; **Promotional Credit can be used only for fees and charges incurred on or after the date you apply the applicable Promotional Credit code to your AWS account and only for the specific Services designated by your AWS contracting entity (collectively, “Eligible Services”)**.

-   **\*Only one**\* team member should complete the steps in this guide to ensure only one AWS account gets created per team. All other team members will be added to the account as [IAM users](). The conference code will be provided once the hackathon kicks off on May 27th.

-   Once you have setup your team's AWS account, you can view these [handy resources](./Technical-Reference-Guide-for-AWS.md) for a quick start on your idea

 
Step 1: Create an AWS account
----------------------------------

An AWS account is simply an Amazon.com account that is enabled to use AWS products; you can use an existing Amazon.com account login and password when creating the AWS account. From your AWS account you can view your AWS account activity, view usage reports, and manage your AWS Security Credentials.

### Already have an AWS account?

If you have already an AWS account, you can skip ahead to [Step 2](#_Step_2:_Create) Create your team IAM users.

### You need a new AWS account?

If not follow the instructions on [How do I create and activate a new Amazon Web Services account?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).

Step 2: Create your team IAM users
-------------------------------------------

Once you created the account to add access to your team members.
Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/), then follow this instructions to [create additional users in your account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html).

Step 3: Request your credit code
--------------------------------------------------------------

Contact edward.kelly27 in Discord, you can also ask for support to any of the  AWS mentors: fnapolitano73, awstodd.

Once you got the code follow these steps: I received a promotional code or credit for AWS services—how do I add it to my AWS account?
 
You can add a promotional code to your AWS account by following these instructions:

1.     Open the Credits page of the Billing and Cost Management console.

2.     In the Promo Code box, type the promotional code.

3.     In the box labeled Please type the characters as shown above, type the code.

4.     Choose Redeem.

If the promotional code was typed correctly, is valid, hasn't expired, and hasn't been previously redeemed, it is added automatically to your AWS account.

Once you have setup your team's AWS account, you can view these [handy resources](./Technical-Reference-Guide-for-AWS.md) for a quick start on your idea.
