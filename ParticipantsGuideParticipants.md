# Participants Guide

[Le français suit](#guide-des-participants)

The key to a successful hackathon is participants (you!) who are willing to think creatively and seek innovative solutions with an open mind.

This is an event that requires Blue Sky Thinking: focus on what is possible, don’t concern yourself with what you think government would do. Innovate!

Spend the beginning of the morning on the first day coming up with ideas and moving on.

* Make note of each of your (amazing) ideas and move on to finding the next one.
  * You want to cover as much ground as possible before you start focusing on a specific idea.
  * This ideation phase is SUPER IMPORTANT, don’t get stuck on one idea and don’t arrive at the hackathon thinking you have already solved it. Work with your team.

There is a tremendous amount of talent in the Public Service and beyond. Focusing that talent for two days and bringing it to bear on a challenge is how a StatCan Hackathon always yields amazing results.

To guarantee that everyone’s talent contributes to the success of your team, make sure each of your teammates always has an opportunity to share their perspective and their ideas.

> The most successful teams are those that best utilize the diversity of experience and skills that their team possesses.

## Design Thinking

* Keep your end user in mind:
  * How does your project benefit the population, align with a sustainable development indicator?
  * What is a user’s typical experience with this problem? Why should they care if you tackle it?
  * How are the proposed solutions or visualizations innovative and different from the status quo?
  * What is the value proposition?

## Schedule

### Day 1 - May 27, 2019

8:30 AM Check-In at the Bayview Yards

* Teams setup their gear at the tables and work begins.
* Each team decides for themselves when work concludes for the day. Teams are not expected to work longer than a normal workday. The location will be open up until 5PM.

### Day 2 - May 28, 2019

* Teams decide on their own when to arrive.
  * Log on Discord, exchange cell phones, stay in touch!
* Work continues throughout the day at whatever schedule best suits each team.
* Around 3:30 or 4:00 PM work will stop and participants are invited to gather at a local (within walking distance) restaurant/bar for Mandatory Fun.
  * This is *not mandatory* but participants are enthusiastically encouraged to socialize and network... and talk about how awesome the hackathon is and how innovative your team’s ideas are!

### Mentors

* These are experts in different fields related to the topic of the hackathon.
* They will be present starting on the first day and available via the Discord channels to answer questions you may have.

### After the hackathon

In the week following the hackathon, participants are encouraged to continue working and promoting their projects.

Since they will be released as open source projects, you may find that governments, private sector or even citizen are interested in further developing them.

Additionnally, all open source projects hosted on the OGP Summit Hackathon organization will be promoted at the OGP Summit to enhance visibility and encourage external contributions!
