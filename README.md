## Projects

All projects should be hosted on this GitHub [organization](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-organizations):

* [OGP Summit Hackathon Sommet PGO](https://github.com/ogp-summit-hackathon-sommet-pgo)

In order to be able to work with GitHub, you will need to [create an account](https://github.com/join).

If you already have an account, please have your handle provided to your teamlead so that you can be added in the organization and have the required rights to push changes to the project.

### Open Source

Unlike typical challenges, the goal of this event is not only to showcase your creativity and innovation skills, but to actually create communities around your project. You will be leveraging open data but also open source software to take on some incredible challenges that all countries are facing.

As such, all projects should be released under an open source licence to increase reuse and encourage collaboration internationally.

If you need help choosing a licence, you can join the #opensource channel on [Discord](#team-communications) or consult these [guidelines](https://github.com/canada-ca/open-source-logiciel-libre/blob/master/en/guides/publishing-open-source-code.md#select-open-source-software-licence) for some additional guidance.

Please note that we will also have open source experts on site and online to support you.

## Team Communications

For the purpose of this event, we opted for a free communications service: [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)

If you already have an account, an invite link will be provided shortly.

Otherwise, please ensure you have an account created to help speed things up before the day of the hackathon.

### On site vs Online

As there will be both people attending in person and online, our mentors will support the teams via both the application and in person on site.

People on site will be able to join channels to request help and mentors will come see them at their table.

People online will be able to message our mentors and voice chat channels will be available for discussing issues.

#### Channels

There will be text channels per topics to request the help of our gracious mentors.

For example, if your team is stuck with a data set issue, you can join the #data-donnees channel and request help.

If you're in person, the available mentor will then join you at your team's table to help. Otherwise, the help can be provided directly in the channel or via a dedicated voice channel. 

## Tools and Services

Our partners are offering a lot of tools and services, as well as mentors to support you in your project.

If your team will require Azure Data Science Virtual Machines, please follow the following [instructions](./AzureSubscriptionSetup.md).
